# Queue System Update - Critical Fixes Applied

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Homepage Product Display (FIXED ✅)
**Problem**: The homepage was showing ALL approved products, including ones waiting in queue
**Solution**: Added `.eq('is_live', true)` filter to only show products currently competing

### 2. Weekly Transition Function (FIXED ✅)
**Problem**: Admin panel "Start New Week" button was failing because `auto_weekly_transition()` function didn't exist
**Solution**: Created the missing database function in `auto-weekly-transition-function.sql`

### 3. Empty State Message (IMPROVED ✅)
**Problem**: Empty state wasn't clear about queue system
**Solution**: Updated message to explain products might be in queue, added link to past launches

## How the Queue System Works Now

### Product States:
1. **Pending** → Awaiting admin approval
2. **Approved + Queue Position** → In queue, waiting to go live
3. **Approved + is_live** → Currently competing this week
4. **Approved + No Queue/Not Live** → Competition ended or rejected

### Weekly Flow:
1. Admin approves products → They get queue positions
2. Admin clicks "Start New Week" → Top 10 queued products go live
3. Previous week's products → Automatically set to not live
4. Queue positions → Automatically reordered starting from 1

## SQL Migrations to Run

Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor:
1. `auto-weekly-transition-function.sql` - Creates the weekly transition function

## Testing the Fix

1. Visit homepage - Should only see products where `is_live = true`
2. Check admin panel - Queue tab should show queued products
3. Test "Start New Week" button - Should move top 10 from queue to live

## Next Steps

With the queue system fixed, consider:
1. **Payment Integration** - Monetize with "Skip the Line" feature
2. **Email Notifications** - Alert users when their product goes live
3. **Social Sharing** - Help products get more visibility
