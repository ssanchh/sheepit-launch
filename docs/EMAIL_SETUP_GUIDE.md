# Email Setup Guide for Sheep It

## Overview
Sheep It uses two email systems:
1. **Resend** - For transactional emails (welcome, product approved, etc.)
2. **Beehiiv** - For the weekly newsletter

## Current Issues & Solutions

### 1. Email Branding (Fixing the Sheep Icon)
The sheep emoji (üêë) appears in your emails because it's hardcoded in the email template. To replace it with your logo:

#### Option A: Use Your Logo Image
```tsx
// In lib/email/templates/base.tsx, replace line 67:
// OLD:
<h1 style={{ margin: 0, fontSize: '24px', fontWeight: 'bold', color: '#2D2D2D' }}>
  üêë Sheep It
</h1>

// NEW:
<img 
  src="https://sheepit.io/logo.png" 
  alt="Sheep It" 
  style={{ height: '40px', width: 'auto' }}
/>
```

#### Option B: Text-Only Logo
```tsx
// Simple text without emoji:
<h1 style={{ margin: 0, fontSize: '28px', fontWeight: 'bold', color: '#2D2D2D' }}>
  Sheep It
</h1>
```

### 2. Connecting Users to Beehiiv Newsletter

#### Current Flow:
- When users sign up ‚Üí They go into your Supabase database
- They receive transactional emails via Resend
- They are NOT automatically subscribed to Beehiiv

#### Recommended Approach:

##### Option 1: Automatic Sync (Recommended)
Add users to Beehiiv when they:
1. Create an account
2. Complete their profile
3. Submit their first product

##### Option 2: Opt-in During Signup
Add a checkbox during registration:
- [ ] Subscribe to weekly newsletter (top products & launch tips)

##### Option 3: Newsletter Component on Site
Use the existing NewsletterSignup component to collect emails

### 3. Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Add Beehiiv Environment Variables
```env
BEEHIIV_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
BEEHIIV_PUBLICATION_ID=your_publication_id_here
```

#### Step 2: Auto-Subscribe New Users
Add to your signup flow:
```typescript
// In app/auth/callback/route.ts, after user creation:
import { subscribeToNewsletter } from '@/lib/newsletter/beehiiv'

// After successful signup
await subscribeToNewsletter(email, userId, 'signup')
```

#### Step 3: Add Newsletter Preference to Profile
Users should be able to manage their subscription in dashboard settings.

Run once to sync current users:
```bash
npm run sync-newsletter-subscribers
```
